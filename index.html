    <h2 id="one"> 
        Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
   Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
   And things are not what they seem.
    </h2>  
      
    
    <h2 id="two"> 
        Life is real! Life is earnest!
        And the grave is not its goal;
     Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
        Was not spoken of the soul.
      
    </h2>  
    
    <h2 id="three"> 
        Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
   Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow
   Find us farther than to-day. 
    </h2>  
      
  
    <h2 id="four"> 
       
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.
    </h2>  
      
   
    <h2 id="five"> 
        In the world’s broad field of battle,
        In the bivouac of Life,
     Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
        Be a hero in the strife!
    <h2 id="six">
            Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
            Let the dead Past bury its dead!
         Act,— act in the living Present!
            Heart within, and God o’erhead!

    </h2>
    <h2 id="seven"> 
            Lives of great men all remind us
            We can make our lives sublime,
         And, departing, leave behind us
            Footprints on the sands of time;
         

    </h2>
    <h2 id= eight>
            Footprints, that perhaps another,
            Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
         A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
            Seeing, shall take heart again.

    </h2>
    <h2 id="nine">
            Let us, then, be up and doing,
            With a heart for any fate;
         Still achieving, still pursuing,
            Learn to labor and to wait.
